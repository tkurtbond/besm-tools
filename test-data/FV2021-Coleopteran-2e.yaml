  description: |
    A three-metre talk British-built humanoid combat walker used by
    the Canadians on Mars.  They use a new “mind-interface”
    neuro-helmet that makes the mecha very agile.  However, if a
    different pilot wants to use the mecha, the neuro-helmet must be
    “retuned” to their brain waves — this takes a full day; until
    then, halve the Defence Mastery and Combat Technique: Lightning
    Reflexes Attribute bonuses.  The mecha are painted standard
    colours: UN white, with sky-blue helmets.
